### Project Scenario
The scenario for the project is as follows:

Our client is a startup online clothing company that specializes in "athleisure" clothing in the US. Their marketing team wants to launch an ad campaign to increase online traffic on their website, which hopefully leads to more revenue. To best allocate time and effort for the launch of the ad campaign and maximize the audience to see their ads, they want to understand 3 things. 

   - Which keywords related to athleisure are consumers searching for most?
   - Which month are consumers searching for athleisure clothing most?
   - Which platform are consumers using most for their searches?

### Project Goals
The goals for the project are as follows:

   -  Based on our findings, we will provide at least 3 confident recommendations to the athleisure startup company's marketing team to figure out the best keywords, best timing, and best platform to run their ads.
   -  We will arrive at these recommendations by analyzing data from Wordtracker - a paid database service with a representative sample of Google, Youtube, and Amazon search query data volume for a 1-year period between June 2018 and May 2019.

### Methodology 
   -  Generate business application (online ad strategy to promote athleisure clothing).
   -  Generate 3 questions related to business application.
   -  Generate 3 null and alternative hypotheses to test and answer the 3 questions.
   -  Find and select a source of data to draw from and analyze (Wordtracker).
   -  Use API to understand database stats for Google, Youtube, and Amazon search volume.
   -  Generate a list of popular athleisure-related keywords (search "athleisure" on Amazon, and find about 100 terms associated with athleisure products on the first few pages of "featured" results).
   -  Call search volume by month, and totals for each keyword on the list from the Wordtracker API.
